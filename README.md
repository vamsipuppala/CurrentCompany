Real-time Transaction Challenge
===============================
## Overview
Welcome to Current's take-home technical assessment for backend engineers! We appreciate you taking the time to complete this, and we're excited to see what you come up with.

You are tasked with building a simple bank ledger system that utilizes the [event sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) pattern to maintain a transaction history. The system should allow users to perform basic banking operations such as depositing funds, withdrawing funds, and checking balances. The ledger should maintain a complete and immutable record of all transactions, enabling auditability and reconstruction of account balances at any point in time.

## Details
The [included service.yml](service.yml) is the OpenAPI 3.0 schema to a service we would like you to create and host.

The service accepts two types of transactions:
1) Loads: Add money to a user (credit)

2) Authorizations: Conditionally remove money from a user (debit)

Every load or authorization PUT should return the updated balance following the transaction. Authorization declines should be saved, even if they do not impact balance calculation.


Implement the event sourcing pattern to record all banking transactions as immutable events. Each event should capture relevant information such as transaction type, amount, timestamp, and account identifier.
Define the structure of events and ensure they can be easily serialized and persisted to a data store of your choice. We do not expect you to use a persistent store (you can you in-memory object), but you can if you want. We should be able to bootstrap your project locally to test.

## Expectations
We are looking for attention in the following areas:
1) Do you accept all requests supported by the schema, in the format described?

2) Do your responses conform to the prescribed schema?

3) Does the authorizations endpoint work as documented in the schema?

4) Do you have unit and integrations test on the functionality?

Here’s a breakdown of the key criteria we’ll be considering when grading your submission:

**Adherence to Design Patterns:** We’ll evaluate whether your implementation follows established design patterns such as following the event sourcing model.

**Correctness**: We’ll assess whether your implementation effectively implements the desired pattern and meets the specified requirements.

**Testing:** We’ll assess the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of your test suite, including unit tests, integration tests, and possibly end-to-end tests. Your tests should cover critical functionalities, edge cases, and potential failure scenarios to ensure the stability of the system.

**Documentation and Clarity:** We’ll assess the clarity of your documentation, including comments within the code, README files, architectural diagrams, and explanations of design decisions. Your documentation should provide sufficient context for reviewers to understand the problem, solution, and implementation details.
